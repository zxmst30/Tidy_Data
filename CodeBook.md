## Code Book

The tidy data file AVGData.txt contains a total of 68 variables. The first two variables are:
* Subject (1-30) and
* Activity (WALKING, WALKING_UP, WALKING_DOWN, SITTING, STANDING, LYING)

The remaining 66 columns are the mean value (denoted as -mean()) and standard deviation (-std()) 
of 33 accelerometer and gyroscope variables, averaged for each subject and activity:

* tBodyAcc-X
* tBodyAcc-Y
* tBodyAcc-Z
* tGravityAcc-X
* tGravityAcc-Y
* tGravityAcc-Z
* tBodyAccJerk-X
* tBodyAccJerk-Y
* tBodyAccJerk-Z
* tBodyGyro-X
* tBodyGyro-Y
* tBodyGyro-Z
* tBodyGyroJerk-X
* tBodyGyroJerk-Y
* tBodyGyroJerk-Z
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-X
* fBodyAcc-Y
* fBodyAcc-Z
* fBodyAccJerk-X
* fBodyAccJerk-Y
* fBodyAccJerk-Z
* fBodyGyro-X
* fBodyGyro-Y
* fBodyGyro-Z
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

More details about the data set and transformations as well as other steps 
performed to generate the clean data set can be found in the README.md file.
